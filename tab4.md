# RECOVERY OF KEY SECTORS
Key sectors of recovery include:
- **environmental:** fire suppression efforts could lead to toxic byproducts in the water system and affect air quality
- **social:** the residents affected by the fire face displacement and health impacts from air quality and burns
- **political:** Taiwan has hundreds of unsafe, mixed-use buildings that are not up to code and pose a threat to safety

# PROPOSED STRATEGIES FOR RECOVERY

1. We should also gather a group of diverse individuals from the community like non profit organizations, experts, and local business so we can avoid duplication in the recovery process as well as gain insight of progress at the community level 
2. Next, we need to focus on developing communication practices that allow disabled individuals to better understand disaster preparedness, to start, we could place these pamphlets at hospitals as opposed to relying on media as they may not have access to online resources
3. Ways to support individuals during the recovery process (Ke et al., 2020, 5): 
- Closely monitor the surrounding environment and inform community members through radios, television news broadcasts, and public announcements
- Ensure the evacuation route is cleared and individuals are aware of the map
- Provide mental aid support to the refugees and work with local shelters to prepare supplies 


# PROPOSED RISK REDUCTION AND MITIGATION

- Increase affordable housing for vulnerable populations and develop locally based post disaster recovery plans (Adams et al., 2019, 15)
- Taiwan also needs stricter enforcement and higher fines because policies and laws are often overlooked due to lax enforcement
- They should create a backup plan for unsafe buildings where it is difficult to get owner approvals to completely remodel.

Governments should develop an alternative plan for remodeling buildings. Currently, it is difficult to reach a decision to rebuild because 100% of the owners in the building have to agree. The problem is that there are hundreds of owners for a single building, a lot of which have moved out of the country.

* This ties into the pay rate where minimum wage is less than $6 per hour. Given that the cost of living is lower in Taiwan, the elderly, disabled, and the poor are often at a disadvantage. **Raising the wage would increase the capacity for others to support these individuals** (Chiang, 2021)

* Develop more effective programs for training and disaster preparedness like implementing training workshops so individuals can practice and be more aware of safe practices (Ke et al., 2020, 3)

* **Mitigation efforts** (Ke et al., 2020, 5)
  * Proactively eliminate factors that exacerbate disasters experiences such as clearing stairwells and hallways of furniture
  * Plan evacuation route and periodically updating the map with respect to changes in layout
  * Assess existing equipment and familiarize residents with the equipment through training and workshops

# TIMELINE & PROCESS
## PRE-DISASTER:
* Before the disaster, we should address the structural inequalities by implementing preventative measures. For example, local governments should increase policy enforcement and make fines high enough that will make building owners take inspections more seriously. Individuals should take responsibility for falsely reporting inspections and ignoring key foundational faults. For example, inspections should report furniture in hallways and blocking stairwells. In addition, we should increase inclusivity for disabled individuals to maximize their capacity for affording safe housing and basic needs.

## DURING THE DISASTER:
* During the disaster, the residents (especially the older and disabled population) may not have access to disaster warnings and are more likely to experience insensitivity due to their age and health (Blinder et al., 2006, 3). Thus, implementing training workshops led by the local government prior to a disaster event would better prepare the residents in the building as they would be aware of the evacuation routes and implement safe practices regarding building safety. 

## AFTER THE DISASTER:
* Post-disaster, we should initialize the recovery process by forming a diverse group of local organization leaders, experts, business owners, and community members.The group will be able to provide insight on the healing and recovery progress as well as make decisions with consideration to background knowledge of the impacted communities.
