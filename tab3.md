## **How exactly is cryptocurrency harming the environment?**

### While well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in popularity, so have their environmental footprint.

The environmental harm of cryptocurrency comes from the energy source that powers these hardworking and competitive computers. With the increase in demand for mining Bitcoin, companies and miners seek cheaper alternatives to run these mining warehouses. 

To maximize profits, mining companies seek locations where energy is cheap. According to the [University of Cambridge](https://cbeci.org/mining_map), over 65% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China, where energy is predominantly powered by coal. 

## **Is there an alternative to mining?**

Currently, large companies like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on a method called “Proof of Work” which are essentially computers racing to solve the puzzle first. The first computer to solve that puzzle then receives Bitcoin as a reward and adds that solution to the blockchain. In other words, the reward depends on the amount of work done by the “miner.” In proof of work, capacity is defined by the computational power. 

However, an alternative method to receive these “blocks” of solution is by “Proof of Stake.” In proof of stake, blocks are distributed according to the amount of stake an individual has. Hence, proof of stake essentially turns the action of mining obsolete.
