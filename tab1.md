# THE FIRE

On October 14th, 2021 at approximately 2:00 AM, a fire struck the Cheng Chung Cheng building located in Kaohsiung (south of Taiwan). This took place in the city of Kaohsiung, on the seventh through eleventh floors of the building. Although the cause of the fire remains unknown, investigators suspect it was ignited by an incense coil that was left in a room unattended (Hale, 2021). It took 159 firefighters and almost 5 hours to extinguish the fire which resulted in 46 deaths, and over 40 injuries.

# THE PEOPLE

The majority of residents were poor, disabled, and older, leaving a large percentage of them trapped in the building when the fire took over. The cheap rent was a main reason the residents endured the unideal living conditions (The Associated Press, 2021).

# THE BUILDING

The 13-story mixed-use building used to house a movie theater and have restaurants on the ground floor until people started moving away and it turned into what locals refer to as the “ghost building.” While the first to fifth floors were abandoned and unoccupied, over 120 households occupied the seventh through eleventh floors. (Everington, 2021)
